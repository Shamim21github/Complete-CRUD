# Complete-CRUD
In Laravel, CRUD operations are essential for interacting with databases. Create operations allow inserting new records, usually via forms. Read operations retrieve data from the database, typically displayed in views. Update operations modify existing data, often using forms with pre-filled values. Delete operations remove records from the database. Laravel's Eloquent ORM simplifies these tasks, making it easy to manage database records using intuitive methods like create(), find(), update(), and delete().
